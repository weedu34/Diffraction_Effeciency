# Diffraction_Effeciency
This repository allows you to calculate the diffraction efficiency of DOE. Please follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the required dependencies.

## Environment Setup

1. **Create Conda Environment:**
   - Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a conda environment named `diffraction_efficiency`:

     ```bash
     conda create --name diffraction_efficiency python=3.8
     ```

2. **Activate Conda Environment:**
   - Activate the conda environment:

     ```bash
     conda activate diffraction_efficiency
     ```

## Install Dependencies

Once the conda environment is activated, install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Notes

- take laser measurement without any DOE so that we can take it as reference and use it afterwards in the whole process for that particular laser.
