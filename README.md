# Diffraction_Effeciency
This repository allows you to calculate the diffraction efficiency of DOE.
- An explanation of the Graphical user interface can be found and read at [Blog](https://github.com/weedu34/Diffraction_Effeciency/wiki/Graphical-User-Interface).
- The detail of the devices can be read from [Blog](https://github.com/weedu34/Diffraction_Effeciency/wiki/Devices).
- The working principle of developed algorithm and working steps can be found at [Blog](https://github.com/weedu34/Diffraction_Effeciency/wiki/Working-Principle).






















- take laser measurement without any DOE so that we can take it as reference and use it afterwards in the whole process for that particular laser.
